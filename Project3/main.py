#Rules of game
# Rock beats Scissors
# Rock smashes scissors, so Rock wins.

# Scissors beat Paper
# Scissors cut paper, so Scissors win.

# Paper beats Rock
# Paper covers rock, so Paper wins.

# Same choice results in a draw
# If both players choose the same option (Rock vs Rock, Paper vs Paper, etc.), itâ€™s a tie.
